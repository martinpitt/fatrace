0.5 (UNRELEASED)
----------------
Improvements:
 - Some code optimizations, thanks Yann Droneaud!
 - power-usage-report: Use current powertop 2 (LP: #937703)
 - power-usage-report: Use Python 3
 - power-usage-report: Include "Process Device Activity" section from powertop

0.4 (2012-02-21)
----------------
Improvements:
 - Add power-usage-report script which uses fatrace and powertop-1.13 to
   collect data about file accesses, wakeups, and device stats and generates a
   developer/power-user oriented report which can be used for identifying power
   usage problems.

0.3 (2012-02-17)
----------------
Bug fixes:
 - Fix --ignore-pid short option (-p, not -i) in --help.
 - Tell apart closing for reading ("C") and closing for writing ("CW"). Point
   this out in the manpage.

0.2 (2012-02-15)
----------------
Improvements:
 - --output does not overwrite already existing files.
 - Some code cleanup and robustification, thanks Yann Droneaud!
 - Proper handling of Control-C (SIGINT), thanks Yann Droneaud!
 - When specifying --timestamp twice, print time as seconds since epoch, which
   is easier for automatic post-processing.

Bug fixes:
 - Listen to "close" events as well.
 - Simplify and robustify determination of path names. This also fixes the
   races which led to many events being shown with device/inode only.

0.1 (2012-02-07)
